# Problem Statement:
*Identification of wildfire through  periodic satellite imagery, and predicting its course in a virtual environment.*
 

# Approach:
1)Periodic satellite scans will reveal the point of origin of fire.<br/>
2)The position of trees and their affinity to catching fire, based on moisture content and wind direction will be analysed with the help  of image analysis and neural networks.<br/>
3)Factors such as position, wind speed(obtained from the openweather api) and the affinity rating of the fire will be passed to the simulation environment.<br/>
4)The simulation will predict the course of wildfire and this data will be streamed to web app which then informs the forest officials through various communication methods(including SMS).<br/>
5)The forest officials can then aid in evacuation of the risk prone regions.
