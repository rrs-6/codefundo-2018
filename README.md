# Problem Statement:
Prediction of wildfire by simulation in a virtual environment and its prevention using connected applications 

# Approach:
1)The  periodic satellite scans will reveal the point of origin of fire.
2)The position of trees and their affinity to catching fire based on moisture content and wind direction, will be analysed with the help of image analysis and neural networks.
3)The position and the affinity rating of the fire will be converted to raw data and passed to the simulation environment where the other factors such as wind obtained from the openweather api which will act as predicting factors in the simulation of the spread of wildfire.
Based on the spread, precautions such as rerouting of the vehicle and evacuating of the residential areas can be undertaken.
