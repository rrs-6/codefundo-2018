# Problem Statement:
*Identification of wildfire through  periodic satellite imagery, and predicting its course in a virtual environment.*
 

# Approach:
1)Periodic satellite scans will reveal the point of origin of fire.<br/>
2)The position of trees and their affinity to catching fire based on moisture content and wind direction, will be analysed with the help of image analysis and neural networks.<br/>
3)Factors such as position, wind speed(obtained from the openweather api) and the affinity rating of the fire will be passed to the simulation environment.<br/>
4)Based on the spread, precautions such as rerouting of the vehicle and evacuating of the residential areas can be undertaken.
